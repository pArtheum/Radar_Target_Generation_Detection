%Design the FMCW waveform by giving the specs of each of its parameters.
% Calculate the Bandwidth (B), Chirp Time (Tchirp) and Slope (slope) of the FMCW
% chirp using the requirements above.

%for Doppler Estimation.

%normalize.

% Output of FFT is double sided signal, but we are interested in only one side of the spect_cell_rangeum.
% Hence we throw out half of the samples.

%% RANGE DOPPLER RESPONSE
% The 2D FFT implementation is already provided here. This will run a 2DFFT
% on the mixed signal (beat signal) output and generate a range doppler
% map.You will implement CFAR on the generated RDM


% Range Doppler Map Generation.

% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and
% doppler FFT bins. So, it is important to convert the axis from bin sizes
% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

%design a loop such that it slides the CUT across range doppler map by
%giving margins at the edges for t_cell_rangeaining and Guard Cells.
%For every iteration sum the signal level within all the t_cell_rangeaining
%cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
%function. Average the summed values for all of the t_cell_rangeaining
%cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.
%Further add the offset to it to determine the threshold. Next, compare the
%signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
%it a value of 1, else equate it to 0.
